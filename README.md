# Smartboards: Nifty plugins for Sketch

Gridify: This plugin aligns your artboards into a series of columns and rows.  Each artboard is renamed by the row they are in (a letter) and a two digit number for the column.  The artboards are separated by 100px, which you can change in the source.

To use, add the "smartboards" folder to ~/Library/Application Support/Sketch/Plugins.  Gridify can be triggered with the keyboard shortcut: "option+command+g"
