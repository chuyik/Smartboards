Smartboards is a collection of plugins that make my life easier in Sketch.

## Gridify

* Aligns artboards to a grid with `100px` gutters
* Renames the artboards based on column and row (`A00`, `A01`, `B00`, `B01`, `B02`)
* Alphabetizes the artboards in the layers list.

###### Shortcut: cmd + opt + g

To install, download "`Smartboards`" as a zip file and then add the folder to your Sketch plugin folder (In Sketch 3, choose `Plugins` > `Reveal Plugins Folder`)
